Machine learning is a growing field of computer science that may seem a bit complicated
 and reserved only to mathematicians. You may have heard of neural networks or k-means
 clustering and don’t undersdand how they work or how to code these kinds of algorithms...
 But don’t worry, we are actually going to start with a simple, basic machine learning
 algorithm.
